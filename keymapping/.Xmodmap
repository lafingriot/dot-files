! well that didn't work out so well.  xev thoght that the keys were rebound correctly and was showing up in the logs as such.  But something else was still over writting caps lock forcing it to not change.  All this did was make it so i didn't have a left control key at all.
! had to resource this file with the origional settings

!keycode 66 = Caps_Lock
!keycode 37 = Control_L
